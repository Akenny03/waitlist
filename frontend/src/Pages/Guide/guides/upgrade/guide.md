# Upgrading

If you're low on ISK, you can start by getting the **Megathron**. If you do, it's important that you focus on upgrading to another ship as soon as possible.

## Starter

**Get a starter fit**. You will need level 2 armor compensation skills to be able to join, and you need to be able to fit all the modules from the fit.

## Basic

**Upgrade to basic** as soon as you can. This will involve training your _armor compensation_ skills and other tank skills, after which you should start replacing modules and rigs. Remember that when you change tank modules or rigs you need to change them all at the same time, or you risk creating holes in your armor resistances. You can leave upgrading the drones for later.

Once you have the basic fit ready to go, continue **training and injecting basic skills** which will help your capacitor stability and the ability to keep up with the fleet.

## Advanced

Once you're out of the starter squad, **upgrade to the advanced fit**. Your skills will already be sufficient, so buy those new modules!

Then, **get your Hybrid implants**. The recommended order for these is slot 10 first (6% extra damage), then slot 8 and 9 (another 6% DPS), then slot 7 (better tracking of targets), followed by slots 1-6. Once your set is complete you can upgrade to the `_hybrid` fit, which adds a lot of damage!

If you've been flying a Nightmare, now is a good time to consider getting the **Paladin** instead. Your expensive modules can be transferred, so you only need to train a few skills to fly the ship, and then buy the hull.

## Elite

Now it's time to get the **elite fit**. You do not need to have every skill at elite level to fly the fit! Go buy those upgrades while still training the non-mandatory skills.

This is a good time to **get abyssal modules**. [mutaplasmid.space](https://mutaplasmid.space/) is a good website for finding contracts, just make sure you buy the good ones!

Finish by getting all the **elite skills**. The order is up to you, but we recommend getting the skills that give the biggest damage increase first, and of course maximize your survivability by upgrading the tank skills.

## Branch out

Once you're **done upgrading**, consider branching out to another ship. Maybe try logistics?

## Elite gold

Finally, once you can fly multiple ships at elite level, get your **elite gold** badge to show off your awesomeness.
